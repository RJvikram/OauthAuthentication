# OauthAuthentication

This section outlines the steps for setting up PostgreSQL credentials for your OauthAuthentication application.


## Important Security Note

* **Store Credentials Securely:** Never store database credentials directly in your code or configuration files. Consider using environment variables or a secure credential management solution.
* **Grant Least Privilege:** The provided approach grants the `oauthuser` all permissions on the `OauthAuthentication` database. It's generally recommended to grant only the minimum permissions required for the application to function.

## Steps

1. **Create User with Secure Password:**

   ```sql
   CREATE USER oauthuser WITH PASSWORD '<STRONG_PASSWORD>';

2. **Create Database and Grant Permissions:**
    ```sql
    psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432
    ```
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE OauthAuthentication;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE OauthAuthentication TO oauthUser;

Make sure to replace localhost:5432 with the actual hostname and port of your PostgreSQL server if it's hosted elsewhere.
This markdown snippet can be included in your repository's README file, providing clear instructions for setting up PostgreSQL credentials for your application.
